# Wiki
We use the [Wiki](https://github.com/BriarSMC/Shoot-My-Challengers/wiki) attached to this repository for this project's development documents. You may
edit those documents within GitHub's Wiki editor, or copy the  Markdown text to your local computer
to edit them there, and copy/paste them back into the Wiki editor.

# Deleted wiki branch

I started the wiki branch to manage the image files. Since we no reference the respository's images in the Wiki docs we no longer need a wiki branch
to maintain them. Live and learn.
